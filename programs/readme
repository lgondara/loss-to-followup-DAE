Description of programs:
1.Impute_LTF_DAE: Python code to implement our default architecture for denoising autoencoder to impute missing data.
2.Introduce missingness: R code to introduce loss to followup in complete datasets and divide them in test and train datasets.
3.Simulate ltf datasets: R code to simulate artificial datasets used in the paper.
4. r_dae_imp: R code to implement a denoising autoencoder for imputation.
